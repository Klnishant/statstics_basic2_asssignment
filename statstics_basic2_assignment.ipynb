    "Ans--> Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe how spread out the data in a dataset is. These measures provide information about how much the individual values in the dataset differ from the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a quick way to get an idea of how spread out the data is. However, it does not take into account the distribution of the data, and is sensitive to outliers. For example, consider the following dataset of exam scores: [70, 72, 75, 78, 80]. The range of this dataset is 10, as the largest value (80) minus the smallest value (70) is 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: The variance is a measure of how much the individual values in a dataset differ from the mean of the data. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each value and the mean, and dividing by the number of values in the dataset. A larger variance indicates that the data is more spread out, while a smaller variance indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. For example, consider the following dataset of exam scores: [70, 72, 75, 78, 80]. The variance of this dataset is approximately 15.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard deviation: The standard deviation is another measure of how much the individual values in a dataset differ from the mean of the data. It is the square root of the variance, and provides a more intuitive measure of the spread of the data, since it is in the same units as the original data. A larger standard deviation indicates that the data is more spread out, while a smaller standard deviation indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. For example, consider the following dataset of exam scores: [70, 72, 75, 78, 80]. The standard deviation of this dataset is approximately 3.97.\n",

    "In summary, measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation provide information about the spread of the data in a dataset.
